- Enlightenment center searching
    - Assign flag based on 'closeness' to center or point of interest
- Genetic programming
    - Can execute games from terminal

[Genetic Programming]
- Build bot based on genetic parameters
    - Passed from command line
- Scaffold executor and best genetic parameters
    - Battle each bot with each other
    - Prune bots based on scores
    - Regenerate new bots
        - Implement crossover

[Seek and Destroy]
- Find enlightenment centers
	- [Failure] Pass distance information through flags
		- Not ideal when capturing new centres
			- No information to source centre
		- Problem: Flag resetting occurs in cycles
			- Exploit that information propagates from target
				- Store parent only
					- IDs do not work due to death
						- How to reassign parent?
	- Passing coordinate information through flags?
		- Maximum coordinate is 15 bits for each axis
			- Not feasible to store all coordinates
			- Sending x and y coordinate separately?
				- Can be further optimised
					- Low grid size means can be uniquely identified
						- Using only last byte of information

[Communication Mechanisms]
- Epoch and Update
	- Send information through local flags
	- When information is stale, update epoch value
	- Only accept information with a "higher" epoch
		- May require rollover scheme
- Collate and Broadcast
	- Each unit stores their birth place
		- Continuously listens for information updates
			- Birth place is point of authority
	- Collated data remains cached for a certain amount of rounds?

[Spawning]
- Adaptive unit influence
	- What metric to best optimize for?
		- Number of existing units
		- Existing influence
- Minimum base influence
	- Adapt towards influence generation capacity

[Pathfinding]
- Goal: Find reasonable paths quickly
- Current complexity: V^2 * 8

[Attacking]
- Prioritize quantity over completeness
	- Removes attack dilution for future attacks

[Bidding]
- If unsuccessful, increase bid amount
- If successful, decrease amount

[Behaviours]
- Scout
	- Any direction
	- Unvisited green tiles only?
	- Border bounce? (angular)
- Slanderer
	- Encircle origin
